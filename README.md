Multi-body Simulation (MBS) for Crank Drive Analysis
This project involves simulating the crank drive of a 2.0L 4-cylinder in-line engine using Siemens NX's Multi-body Simulation (MBS) tools. The simulation process includes modeling the engine's crankshaft, pistons, and connecting rods, and performing kinematic and dynamic analyses at various speeds. Key tasks involve defining motion joints, assigning drives, and creating sensors to measure piston displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The results, including time-based graphs and animations, are analyzed to evaluate system performance and smoothness at different operating conditions, highlighting the effects of speed changes on the engineâ€™s dynamic behavior.
